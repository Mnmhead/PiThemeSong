Have you ever wanted a themesong to play when you enter your home?
Now made possible by themesong.py!

Configure the themesong with your phone's or laptop's mac address 
and a song of your choice. Whenever the device connects to the nextwork,
the song will play. 

To configure the program simply create a text file called 'macs.txt'.
Inside, write a MAC address on the first line followed by a filepath to an mp3
on the next line.  In this way, lines alternate between MAC address and filepath
with the first line being a MAC address.
